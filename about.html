  <p class="subtitle">How ET Naturals began — and why we do things differently.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <p>ET Naturals began at home.</p>

    <h2 class="section">Why We Started Making Home Essentials</h2>

    <p><strong>We didn’t set out to create laundry detergent.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>We were just trying to solve a problem for our grandson.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>
      He has extremely sensitive skin, and even products labeled “baby-safe”
      or “hypoallergenic” caused frequent irritation. We tried everything —
      including popular store-bought natural detergents and laundry sheets —
      but nothing consistently worked.
    </strong></p>

    <p>
      That experience was frustrating, heartbreaking, and eye-opening all at once.
      Watching him struggle made us realize how difficult it is to find products
      that are both gentle <em>and</em> effective — even in the natural space.
    </p>

    <p>So Traci started making her own.</p>

    <h2 class="section">From One Formula to a Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      By carefully selecting ingredients and removing anything unnecessary,
      Traci created a simple laundry detergent that worked better for our family.
      After switching, we noticed a meaningful difference in how his skin reacted
      to freshly washed clothes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Encouraged by that experience, she kept refining.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the laundry detergent felt right, Traci began experimenting with a
      dishwasher formula — again focusing on clean ingredients and real performance.
      After multiple rounds of adjustment, the result surprised us: it cleaned
      better than the pods we had been using, without harsh scents or residue.
    </p>

    <p>
      That process became the foundation of ET Naturals.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section">How We Create Our Products</h2>

    <p><strong>Formulated. Used. Re-formulated. Adjusted.</strong></p>

    <p>
      All products are formulated, used, re-formulated, and adjusted until they
      work <strong>amazingly</strong> for us at home — before we ever offer them
      on our website.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Developed in small batches</li>
      <li>Used consistently in real daily routines</li>
      <li>Refined until performance and simplicity align</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section">Expanding Beyond the Home</h2>

    <p>
      As ET Naturals grew, that same approach carried naturally into personal care.
    </p>

    <p>
      Root Renewal was created using this exact philosophy — a simple, dependable
      hair and scalp routine made from a short list of thoughtfully chosen
      ingredients.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it’s hair and scalp care, laundry essentials, dishwasher products,
      or candles, every ET Naturals formula begins the same way — with real use,
      real feedback, and real refinement at home.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section">Our Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      We believe the best products earn their place in your routine.
      ET Naturals focuses on purposeful ingredients, simple routines,
      and products made for real homes and real people.
    </p>

    <p>
      What began as a way to help our grandson has grown into a line of
      natural essentials for everyday living — thoughtfully made,
      carefully tested, and shared with intention.
    </p>
