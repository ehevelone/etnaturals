  <h1>Whole Body Reset</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    A foundations-first approach to understanding why healing efforts often fail —  
    and how to move forward more safely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whole Body Reset was created after watching countless people jump into detoxes,
    protocols, and aggressive strategies before their body was ready —
    often making things worse instead of better.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Just because something works doesn’t mean it works first.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
  <p>
    Most people don’t fail because they didn’t try hard enough.
    They fail because the body wasn’t supported in the right order.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hydration before detox</li>
    <li>Capacity before intensity</li>
    <li>Stability before deeper work</li>
    <li>Understanding before action</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Whole Body Reset Is Structured</h2>
  <p>
    Whole Body Reset is not a single program or protocol.
    It is a layered system designed to reduce overwhelm,
    prevent backtracking, and support long-term progress.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Foundations (Where Everyone Starts)</h3>
  <p>
    Foundations focuses on understanding why detox and advanced strategies often fail
    when the basics are missing. This includes hydration, pacing, nervous system support,
    and learning how to listen to early signals from the body.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can begin Foundations in two ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Read the Foundations book</strong> — to understand the framework</li>
    <li><strong>Join Guided Foundations</strong> — for ongoing, gentle guidance and support</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Guided Support (Optional, Ongoing)</h3>
  <p>
    Some people want help applying the concepts slowly and safely.
    Guided Foundations provides weekly focus suggestions, check-ins,
    and education — without pressure or rigid timelines.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Advanced Context (Not a Starting Point)</h3>
  <p>
    Deeper topics and advanced material exist,
    but they are never the first step and are not appropriate for everyone.
    When explored, they are framed as educational context —
    not instructions or medical treatment.
  </p>

  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>People who feel stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure what to try next</li>
    <li>Those who have tried protocols or detoxes that felt like too much</li>
    <li>Individuals who have been given diagnoses or labels, yet still don’t feel like they’re improving</li>
    <li>Those who have followed conventional approaches and are seeking deeper understanding rather than more intensity</li>
    <li>People who have been told “everything looks normal,” but don’t feel well in their day-to-day life</li>
    <li>Anyone who wants to slow down, rebuild capacity, and move forward more safely</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <i>
      ***Whole Body Reset does not attempt to diagnose, treat, or replace medical care.
      It exists to help people better understand their body’s responses and avoid common sequencing mistakes.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h2>Who This Is <i>Not</i> For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>People looking for a quick fix or aggressive detox</li>
    <li>Anyone expecting step-by-step medical treatment plans</li>
    <li>Those unwilling to move at their body’s pace</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="cta-box">
    <h2>Start With Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      If this approach resonates, Foundations is where to begin.
      You can start by reading, or choose guided support.
    </p>

    <a class="button" href="/wholebodyreset/foundations">
      Go to Foundations
    </a>
  </div>

  <h2>What to Expect When You Begin</h2>
  <p>
    Most people start with understanding, not action.
    If you choose guided support, you’ll receive gentle weekly focus suggestions,
    check-ins to help you pace yourself, and ongoing education — not rigid plans.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are never required to move forward faster than you’re comfortable with.
    Staying where you are is always an option.
  </p>

  <h2>A Note on Expectations</h2>
  <p>
    Whole Body Reset does not promise outcomes, timelines, or cures.
    It exists to help people slow down, make more informed decisions,
    and avoid common mistakes that derail progress.
